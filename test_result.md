The AI status endpoint shows that all three required AI services (Gemini, RunwayML, and ElevenLabs) are now working correctly with valid API keys. Project management APIs are working correctly. However, the video analysis API is failing due to Gemini API quota limitations (429 Too Many Requests). This prevents testing the complete workflow as the plan generation, chat, and video generation APIs all depend on successful video analysis. The backend implementation appears correct, but testing is limited by API rate limits."
